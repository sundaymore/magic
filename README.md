# magicexpr

## introduce
magicexpr is an code generation engine for any format code, by using a group of command executor.

## expression 

Actually, an expression in magicexpr is just a command that promise to return a string result. and there is a group of inner engine commands as basic commands, and you can expand the command set if necessary.  

let's see a simple expression: 
  ```{const helloworld}```    
output: 
  ```helloworld```  

the word "const" is command name, "helloworld" is first param of "const". the function of const command is just return the first param  

## rule
### three rule
There is three rules that defines the workflow of code generation engine.  
- 1. the code engine can only receive one command as input
- 2. the command contain several params, maybe one? or maybe zero? or maybe more!
- 3. a param can be a string value, also a param can be a command.

#### for example
we can construct a expression like  
  ```{const {const helloworld}}```  

the inner expression ```{const helloworld}``` is as a param of the first "const" command.  

#### go further 
we can make it go further, to show a more complex expression:  
  ```{const {const hello}{const world}} ```  


additionally, if there is no outermost express like  

  ```{const o}{const k}```  


the engine will wrap it by const command  
  ```{const {const o}{const k}}
